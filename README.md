- [x] Build with TypeScript (types included)
- [x] Single peer dependency `react`
- [x] Solid code coverage
- [x] Styling with SASS
- [x] Minimal footprint

## Features

- [x] Supports (but doesn't require) redux store
- [x] Configurable refresh (rate based on desired FPS)
- [x] Comes with timer based on `requestAnimationFrame`
- [x] No singletons

## What's next?
